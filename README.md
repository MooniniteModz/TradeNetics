Follow these steps to get TradeNetics up and running.

### Prerequisites

*   [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
*   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
*   A [Binance](https://www.binance.com/) account with API keys.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TradeNetics.git
cd TradeNetics
```

### 2. Set Up the Database

This project uses a PostgreSQL database running in a Docker container. A PowerShell script is provided to automate the setup.

1.  **Open a PowerShell terminal.**
2.  **Navigate to the project directory.**
3.  **Run the setup script:**

    ```powershell
    ./Deploy-PostGre.ps1
    ```

4.  The script will start the database container and output a **connection string**.

### 3. Configure the Application

1.  **Open `appsettings.json`.**
2.  **Update the connection string:** Replace `"your_connection_string_here"` with the one provided by the setup script.
3.  **Set your API keys:** The application requires your Binance API key and secret to be set as environment variables.

    **In PowerShell:**
    ```powershell
    $env:BINANCE_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    $env:BINANCE_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"
    ```

    **In Bash (for Linux/macOS):**
    ```bash
    export BINANCE_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    export BINANCE_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"
    ```

### 4. Run the Application

You can now run the application from your terminal:
