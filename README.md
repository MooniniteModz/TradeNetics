🧩 How It Works
1. Data Collection
📊 Binance API → Raw Market Data (OHLCV)
├── Current Prices (BTC, ETH, ADA)
├── 24hr Statistics (Volume, Price Change)
└── Historical Klines (Candlestick Data)
2. Feature Engineering
csharp🔬 Technical Analysis Pipeline
├── RSI Calculation (14-period)
├── Moving Averages (5 & 20-period)  
├── Bollinger Bands (20-period, 2σ)
├── MACD Signal Line
└── Volume Ratio Analysis
3. AI Prediction
🤖 ML.NET Classification Model
Input:  [Price, Volume, RSI, MACD, MA5, MA20, ...]
Output: { Action: "BUY", Confidence: 87.3% }
4. Trade Execution
💰 Automated Trading Logic
├── BUY Signal  → Place Market/Limit Order
├── SELL Signal → Close Position
└── HOLD Signal → Monitor & Wait
5. Visual Data Flow

🚨 IMPORTANT: This is educational software for learning ML.NET and algorithmic trading concepts.

Never risk money you can't afford to lose
Start with paper trading or very small amounts
Past performance doesn't guarantee future results
Cryptocurrency trading is highly volatile and risky
Always do your own research (DYOR)
